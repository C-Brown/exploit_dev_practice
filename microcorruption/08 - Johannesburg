This is an overflow again.  The password check does not matter at this point.

After the output, "That password is not correct.", There is a byte check at the 17th char in the overflow:
cmp.b #0x64, 0x11(sp)

so the 18th byte should be 0x64.  After that check passes, it adds 0x12 to sp and returns, which means the return address overwrite needs to be at the 19th byte (right after our check for length).  Place our return adress at 18th byte and point it to "unlock_door" at 4446

pw is:
4141414141414141414141414141414141644644
A*17 + byte(0x64) + byte(0x4644)
