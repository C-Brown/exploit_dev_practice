house of force - 
  works against glibc < 2.29 (no top chunk size integrity checks)
  overwrite the top chunk's size descriptor so we can allocate to an address we want to overwrite (possibly wrapping around back to the binary)
  
  code execution, we could possibly overwrite malloc hook --> __malloc_hook so that when malloc is called, it executes at the address we wrote in.
