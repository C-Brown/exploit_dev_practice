main calls login.

login calls test_password_valid which uses the 7d interrupt to check if the password is correct.  We don't need to worry about this since there is nothing we can do about the return value from this interrupt.  

After test_password_valid returns, r15 will contain 0 so, there is only 1 check before it passes off to unlock_door.   which is that byte 0xb1 is the seventeeth byte of the input.
