This seems it has a bit of "packed" code.  it decrypts some bytes then jumps to it.  The debugger itself makes it hard to view the code that is coming so as far as I know with this tools, we just step and view "Current Instruction. 

Since the debugger auto breaks after input, I just used that to find the input and stepped after to find where the pw validation happens. 

Right after input, there is a:
  cmp #0x793e, -0x24(r4)
  
  If the compare fails, it closes.  So, it would seem that that is the password.  
  
  Submitting pw: 3e79 (don't forget endianness) and it works!
