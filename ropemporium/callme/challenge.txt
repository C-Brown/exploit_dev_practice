Reliably make consecutive calls to imported functions. Use some new techniques and learn about the Procedure Linkage Table.

Correct order
Important:
To dispose of the need for any RE we'll tell you the following:
You must call callme_one(), callme_two() and callme_three() in that order, each with the arguments 1,2,3 e.g. callme_one(1,2,3) to print the flag. The solution here is simple enough, use your knowledge about what resides in the PLT to call the callme_ functions in the above order and with the correct arguments. Don't get distracted by the incorrect calls to these functions made in the binary, they're there to ensure these functions get linked. You can also ignore the .dat files and the encrypted flag in this challenge, they're there to ensure the functions must be called in the correct order.
