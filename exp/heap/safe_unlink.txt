Unlink macro ->

    C = Chunk

    BK = C->bk
    FD = C->fd
    FD->bk = BK
    BK->fd = FD

A safe unlink will happen under these conditions (security checks):
    aborts if:
        fd->bk != unlinking chunk
        bk->fd != unlinking chunk

This makes it pretty challenging to put target chunks in the fd or bk fields of prev chunks.
