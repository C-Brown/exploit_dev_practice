Setting up for kernel debugging - 
  msconfig.exe for gui -> Boot -> Adv. Opts. -> check Debug
  or
  bcdedit.exe -debug on (elevated cmd)
  Then reboot
  
Launch WinDbg elevated -> File | Kernel Debug... | Local     (local kernel debugging), remote different.

Remote debugging with vmware OS - 
  bcdedit /dbgsettings serial debugport:n baudrate:115200
  where n is the number of a COM port on the virtual machine
  or
  via gui, can do msconfig Boot->Adv. Opts. -> debug port

VMWare, add serial port:
  Use named pipe: \\.\pipe\com_1
  This end is the server

Launch windbg elevated with this command:
  windbg.exe -y "srv*d:\symbols*https://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols" -k com:pipe,port=\\.\pipe\com_1,resets=0,reconnect
  
  
LiveKD from sysinternals allows kernel debugging without configuring the machine in debug mode.  Installs a kernel driver.  Copy LiveKd.exe to dir of WinDbg
  launch with livekd -w
  syncronization issues so it may not be the best option but does work. requires "refresh" by restarting livekd to get it sync'd
