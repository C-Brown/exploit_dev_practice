%s - prints as a string
%p - prints as a pointer
%x - prints as hex
%d - prints as decimal
%u - prints unsigned decimal
%n - number of bytes written so far  (this is the write)

Direct Parameter access - 
	%3$p -> access 3rd parameter

Short writes - 
	%hn -> write 2 bytes at address, so we don't have to write a full 4 bytes in 1 go. 
	
	needing to write a lower value after already writing a higher value, you can add 1 before the 2 bytes so it is higher. 
	Writing 41424344, already wrote 4344 so need to write 4142 next..     do 14142 - 4344 = next write count. 

GOT overwrite -> 
	address of exit@plt ->     x/4i <plt addr>   ->  use the GOT address from the first jmp

Options for location to point your overwrite to:
	new function address
	environment variable address
